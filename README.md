# InterviewPrepAlgorithms


These are examples of algorithms and data structures to review when preparing for a Front End Interview.

### General Scoping
  Before diving in, make sure you understand the scope of the problem you are being asked to solve
  
  * What is the expected behavior
  * What are the inputs?  (data structure, units, etc.)
  * What are the outputs?
  * Any special considerations (should the algorithm be stable?)
  * If you don't know the formula or definition of a term, ask.
    
### Conditions to keep in mind when approaching the problem:
  * Boundary condition
  * Handling of duplicates
  * Null conditions
  
### Items to include:
  * Write out example test data
  * Be able to describe alternative approaches
  * Address performance/efficiency
  * Address scalability
  * Address extensibility
