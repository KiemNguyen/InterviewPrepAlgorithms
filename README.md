# InterviewPrepAlgorithms


These are examples of algorithms and data structures to review when preparing for a Front End Interview.

### General Scoping
  Before diving in, make sure you understand the scope of the problem you are being asked to solve
  
    * What is the expected behavior
    * What are the inputs?  (data structure, units, etc.)
    * What are the outputs?
    * Any special considerations (should the algorithm be stable?)
    * If you don't know the formula or definition of a term, ask.
    
### Conditions to keep in mind when approaching the problem:
  * Boundary condition
  * Handling of duplicates
  * Null conditions
  
### Items to include:
  * Write out example test data
  * Be able to describe alternative approaches
  * Address performance/efficiency
  * Address scalability
  * Address extensibility

    Take special note at time 13:00 - discussion of how to approach underspecified problems.
